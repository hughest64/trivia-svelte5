// utils.ts - helper functions for testing

// NOTES:
// test - game/1234 (points beyond? chat, leaderboard, etc?) - I thnk not until they are fleshed out

// keep guest login test in test.ts (rename?) test goto('/') for these
// also test staff vs. non-staff login there (team-select vs. host choice)

// use the auth fixture in separate file for testing game play things (staff vs non-staff not important here)
// test websocket connection?

// test logout and forgot?

export const login = () => console.log('testing rulZ!');
